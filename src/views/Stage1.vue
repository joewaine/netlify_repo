																												Identifying and creating natural ways to foster and maintain professional relationships leads to deeper connections, long-term loyalty, and trust. And trust translates to healthy sales. At this first stage of the sales journey, you’re intent on identifying new prospects. Not just any prospects, but those who are able to make purchase decisions for their company.
																								</p>
																								<p>
																												You certainly have more resources today than sellers did a decade ago. The internet, social platforms, and professional online groups help you cast a much wider net, but how can you best capture the right contacts? Blindly shooting for the moon and hoping you land among the stars sounds great, but it’s just not realistic. There are several challenges to finding the right leads.

																												Identifying key decision makers</h2>
																								<p class="top-pad-sm">
																												Even after you spend a great deal of time and energy, it can be difficult to identify the right people. Your job is to build relationships with dozens of decision makers and influencers who work in diverse fields and are responsible for a wide variety of functions. And given that roles are always changing, and prospects are moving from one company to another, you’re faced with a seemingly never-ending task.

																																				<p class="top-pad-lg">
																																								Imagine being able to connect with every member of a company’s buying committee, prioritize your efforts and act on valuable insights to target prospects who make the most sense, and then take advantage of your existing connections to reach out to new leads and create a list to focus on those that matter most.
																																				</p>
																																				<p>
																																								Technology makes it easier for you to find key decision makers and influencers. LinkedIn’s professional network can exponentially increase the pool from which you can seek out and engage with new contacts and identify potential leads from your first, second, and third connections.

																												Connecting with credibility</h2>
																								<p class="top-pad-sm">
																												Targeting the right prospects used to mean making countless cold calls, and repeating the same sales pitch over and over. Today, buyers have higher expectations, and you have better tools that can target new audiences and shorten the sales cycle.
																								</p>
																								<p>
																												Cold calling has flatlined, but reaching out in other ways—social platforms or email—is still a chilly way to attempt to make a connection. A warm referral is four times more likely to result in a sale than a cold call.1

																																								Take advantage of existing relationships to increase the likelihood of getting a response from new leads. Broaden your reach by tapping into your company’s network and your colleagues’ relationships for warm introductions. Once you’ve begun building a relationship with a new account, use that connection to find others within the same company. Search for similar connections at other accounts to continue growing your network.

																																								When you locate the right leads, you’re halfway to your goal. Your next step is to use modern tools to make deeper connections, draw insights from data, and communicate seamlessly across any device to grow your customer relationships over time.

																	Customers come to you because they have problems. You solve those problems. But what if you could anticipate and solve the problems they don’t yet realize they have? Relationship selling focuses on listening to your prospects and customers and recognizing opportunities.

																			The challenge at this stage is identifying those opportunities and knowing when you have the best odds of being heard.</p>

																												Understanding your buyers’ pains, challenges, goals, and needs</h2>
																								<p class="top-pad-sm">
																											You’ve undoubtedly heard the infamous statistic that claims most buyers are nearly 70% of the way to a buying decision before they engage a salesperson. It’s a tough sell when your customers have already researched the competition and are on the tail end of their purchase decision

																																				Contrary to popular belief, buyers don’t want to do all the work themselves. Although it might be true that buyers aren’t likely to depend on sellers for all the information they need to make a decision, that doesn’t mean they don’t welcome your educated advice. With valuable insights around company growth, recent news articles, and trends, you’ll be in a better position to understand each customer’s current needs and mindset and where they are in the buying cycle

																																	Relationship selling focuses on the person, not the sale. Armed with this relevant data, you can address real customer concerns and offer recommendations and insights to begin building trust.

																											Evaluate each customer relationship. Build a health profile from data based on transactions, customer sentiment, emails and content exchanges, and frequency and level of customer interactions from CRM, email, and social networks. Predictive analytics doesn’t just allow you to determine where new business opportunities lie. It also uncovers potential risks for each account—like reaching out during a prospect’s busiest week—so you know which contacts to reach out to, and how. With a clear picture of each sales relationship, you can proactively focus on those who need your attention and give space to those who don’t.
																																				</p>
																																				<p>
																																					Machine learning lets you know exactly when to re-engage an inactive buyer and helps you determine which customer emails are the most critical. Artificial intelligence–driven insights can deliver recommended next actions that enhance the experience for you and your customers.
